## LangVIEW

The Consortium on Language Variation in Input Environments around the World (LangVIEW for short) is a network of students and researchers interested in how children use their language experiences to learn about their native language(s). 

We have a mailing list (~1 email/month) and a monthly scientific seminar (an online talk). Nothing is mandatory, and the hope is that people take out much more than they put in (e.g., they can more easily present their work at symposia).

### Key questions

The network was started in 2020, when we circulated this message in extant mailing lists:

> Much of the language learning literature presumes a standard model of learning: that child-directed speech input – particularly within high-quality, one-on-one interactions – drives the learning of sounds, words, and morphosyntax. Higher quantities of input thus are assumed to lead to faster uptake (e.g., more words being learned) and faster processing (e.g., faster word recognition). Although this standard model is widespread, it is based on incomplete and non-representative data. Few studies provide quantitative detail on the **links between input, uptake, and processing**. Further, the base of studies that inform this model represent only a very narrow slice of the human population (a WEIRD slice, at that!). 
> Many of us are pursuing research projects related to this standard model in understudied populations, and are hence widening the field’s perspective. However, we have been collecting our data independently with non-standardized measures of input, uptake, and processing. This diversity of measures may end up making it more difficult to verify true cross cultural differences because of differences in methodology. Further, some researchers may have developed methods or measures that could be used to effectively address specific questions on language input-outcome relationships in a variety of populations (e.g., input-phonological development), but there is currently no easy way to consult or engage a network of experts researchers on this topic at present.
> We propose to coordinate across researchers working on language input-outcome measures in order to (a) increase the comparability of the data gathered on primary measures; (b) facilitate acquisition of additional measures; (c) facilitate dissemination of analytic best practices, and (d) assess the fit of the standard model across cultures.

### Why join

Here's why it's beneficial to join:
- to get feedback on experimental design, 
- to get feedback on a paper you're writing up and see what likely reviewers would say, 
- to discuss how language experiences may relate to language outcomes with other experts regularly, rather than only at conferences.
- to connect with others - potential supervisors if you are a student or postdocs, and potential collaborators at all stages in your career
- to hear about opportunities to promote more international research via organized symposia (e.g., pre-MPaL workshop in 2020) and online schools (e.g., [/L+/ 2021](https://www.dpss.unipd.it/summer-school-2021/home))
