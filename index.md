## LangVIEW

The Consortium on Language Variation in Input Environments around the World (LangVIEW for short) is a network of professionals (students, practitioners, clinicians, researchers, and others)[^1] interested in how young children across the world use their language experiences to learn about the ambient language(s) (i.e., used in and/or outside the home). 

We have a mailing list (~1 email/month) and a monthly scientific seminar (an online talk). Nothing is mandatory, and the hope is that people take out much more than they put in (e.g., they can more easily present their work at symposia).

### Why join our mailing list

Here's why it is beneficial to join:
- to get feedback on experimental design, 
- to get feedback on a paper you're writing up and see what likely reviewers would say, 
- to discuss how language experiences may relate to language outcomes with other experts regularly, rather than only at conferences.
- to connect with others - potential supervisors if you are a student or postdocs, and potential collaborators at all stages in your career
- to hear about opportunities to promote more international research via organized symposia (e.g., pre-MPaL workshop in 2020) and online schools (e.g., [/L+/ 2021](https://www.dpss.unipd.it/summer-school-2021/home))

## Our mission

Our _overarching mission is to understand what are the causal links between (1) children's experiences and (2) language outcomes via (3) the child's learning and processing mechanisms_. Defining children's experiences, learning and processing mechanisms, and language outcomes is not straightforward, and is part of our discussions. Moreover, both these definitions and the causal processes involved are complex, with social and cultural factors affecting all of them, and with potentially complicated feedback loops that assure the child an active role. In this complex setting, relevant research may not include all three key aspects (experiences, outcomes, mechanisms).

Our aim is to understand these causal links for as many diverse languages and populations as possible, and not just the populations that are more commonly studied (typically-developing children growing up in USA/Western Europe)

To this end, we discuss the development of toolkits and theories with a concern that they be adaptable across languages and cultures, and that they can shed light on individuals' language learning environments and trajectories

This does not mean all LangVIEW members agree on what the toolkits and theories could be; for instance, some of us believe word checklists can play this role and others do not. In fact, some members believe it is impossible to capture individual development in a standardized way!

Additionally, we are all open to hearing about when a theory or toolkit does not "work" in some language and culture, as we believe such limits can be insightful. 

Some of our members are also members of other networks (see [Language acquisition networks, initiatives, and resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nbz7HB242OzKEYFhzim6SX5S0jLVU0rYZULrHRlsC5U/edit) for a growing list). LangVIEW's unique angle is that it is built around a single conceptual question (the causal link between experiences and outcomes). 

## Our shorter term goals

Our overarching mission is ambitious. To make our progress visible, we have selected the following goals for the first half of 2022:

1. Hold a monthly seminar. Content will vary (lexicon, phonology, etc.); presenters and/or discussants will have experience with under-represented languages and cultural backgrounds. The seminar organizers are Janet Bang and Eon-Suk Ko. Please get in touch with them about presenting your own work, or suggesting someone else.
2. Support efforts of self-organization by one international areal network (Latin America), which may include:
    - Augment our [Language acquisition networks, initiatives, and resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nbz7HB242OzKEYFhzim6SX5S0jLVU0rYZULrHRlsC5U/edit) with information from that area
    - Augment our [lists of experts on different subtopics in early language acquisition](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1051fgYOteMh2g0S1iOZts_HBzMnLlg0mxy-krkeVvN4/edit#gid=0) with experts from that area
    - Support discussions on what are key barriers and how to lift them
    - Inasmuch as possible, support other initiatives by that network (e.g., an international summer/winter school)
    The board members involved in this initiative are Alex Cristia and Paulina Aravena Bravo. Please get in touch with them for more information on this initiative.
3. Liaise with international professional organizations/societies to summarize extant initiatives to increase diversity, assess evidence for barriers to diversity, and potential impact of possible changes (including a set of guidelines for paper and abstract reviewing). The board members involved in this initiative are Caroline Rowland, Paulina Aravena Bravo, and Michael C. Frank. Contact them for more information on this initiative.
